How can we make [[Benefits of Education]] a reality? 

Big problem here - Education studies are often very varied, and thus it's hard to measure their effectiveness
- Falls into the measuring problems defined in [[Seeing Like a State]]

1) Early Childhood Intervention - Children are often too malnoruished to go to school
	1) Big one here - Iodine Deficiency

2) Perception gaps about education 
3) Structured Pedagogy 
	1) Teaching teachers how to teach
	2) Creating curriculum for students 
4) Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)

	2) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JzmsKJFHPq3j1vAypy8yZM7NbGRco6e_S5con3TOTI/edit# 
5) School Means
	1) Mainly impact in attendance, not much else 
6) Building schools
7) More teachers
8) Financial Incentives to go to school


What didn't work 
1) Vocational training - don't really have much positive impact on employment 
2) Schoalrships - only increase enrolment rates slighly
	1) But maybe the group that is enrolled is different? And this more benefit as a whole? 
3) Computer Assisted Learning is very mid

4) Teacher Incentives
	1) Worry of teachers "teaching to the test"
5) Inputs
	1) Adding teachers doesn't help (??? - **Policy insight: Improving learning**)
	2) Some basic supplies help 
6) Grants - too general
